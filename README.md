# C# Player’s Guide – Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from *The C# Player’s Guide* book.

Each folder represents a different challenge or exercise from the book. I am using this project to practice C# fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in programming.

The purpose of this repository is to track my learning progress and apply concepts such as control flow, enums, methods, and basic object-oriented programming through hands-on coding.
